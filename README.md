# Amazon Employee Access Challenge

---

Hello In this project, we will work with real-life historical data from Amazon. This challenge is worth \$5,000 on Kaggle. Unlike the previous projects, this one will introduce you to the **CatBoost library**, developed by Yandex engineers, which is widely used for search, recommendation systems, personal assistants, self-driving cars, weather prediction, and many other applications. I will walk you through some of the most powerful features of CatBoost while applying it to the Amazon dataset.

We will begin by importing the necessary libraries using **PyForest** and then loading our dataset, which is provided in two separate files: the training file and the test file. I will also show you an alternative method to load the dataset directly using CatBoost’s built-in functionality. After loading, we will perform data visualization to better understand the dataset and check correlations between the various features.

Once the dataset is ready, we will build our model using the **CatBoost Classifier**. I will also show you how to visualize the decision trees and evaluate our model using cross-validation. We will identify the most significant features contributing to the predictions using the `get_feature_importance` function. After that, we will compare the correlation between our dataset features and the model predictions to understand its performance better. Finally, I will demonstrate an alternative approach using **Logistic Regression** together with **One-Hot Encoding** to achieve a similar result.

As you can see, CatBoost is an incredibly powerful library, and when applied to the Amazon dataset, it provides an excellent opportunity to explore advanced machine learning techniques. Let’s get started!
